# YourProjectName

TODO documentation

## Getting Started

Find and replace all instances of the symbols (case insensitive):

- `your-project-name`
- `YourProjectName`

and replace it with the name of your repo.

## Customizing the build

### Vite

See here for docs on how to add multiple entry points: [Vite Library Mode](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html#library-mode)

### Husky

By default, pre-commit hook will run `npm run lint:fix`. Feel free to remove that if it's undesirable or add your own
pre-commit commands.

Check out [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky) docs for more info.
